							<p>
								Welcome to <b><u>Asephri.net!</u></b> 
								On this site, you'll find my personal projects, experiments and ideas, all made with creativity, 
								anger and a love for the web I grew up with. From shitty games to random scripts I've got them all. 
								<br></br>
								There's also a gallery with pixel art and 3d model-gifs that form the basis for my games I've made over the years, they are all very simple but it is what it is..
								<br></br>
								There's also a collection of game servers for you to come and play on. 
								They most likely are down currently as I'm looking for a new host but reach out if you'd like to join and be added to the whitelist for the game you want!.
								<br></br>
								Feel free to explore, give feedback, or just enjoy the place. Thanks for stopping by!</p>

								The website is finally live!, its been a few months since i did any work on the codebase etc but after many iterations and some research i'm finally done. 
								
								The hosting started yesterday with an older version of the sites code, quickly remodeled to enable me to get something up. From there I began work on this version which is version 6.something for those who care.
								
								Looking at other peoples personal sites and pages really helped to get an idea how best to structure this without it being a god damn mess. This is a bento style flex box page at this point but hey, its still not completely mobile compatible lol.
								
								The game downloads still work they are just located on my Github now and they are private. I want to polish them abit before letting them be public access again. They have glaring issues and its not a nice representation of me or good work despite it being pretty good.

								The scripts and programs also need work as they could be more user friendly rather than having to know how they work and tie into other scripts I created.
								<br></br>
								<b><u>Whats next?</u></b>
								<br>
								My next goals are quite simple.
								<ul>
									<li>Expand, maintain the code for the site.</li>
									<li>Refactor and polish previous projects.</li>
									<li>Find a home for the game servers.</li>
									<li>Improve art and music skills for future projects.</li>
								</ul>
								And so much more I cant think of yet. This year has been busy for me in many personal and academic ways.
								
								I'd like to restore the blog pages and expand them to allow proper post management as well, for now this way works.

								This has been a fun project and I hope to expand it more in the future.
